Max Windowed Range

Given an array, and a window size w, find the maximum range (max - min) within a set of w elements.

Let's say we are given the array [1, 2, 3, 5] and a window size of 3. Here, there are only two cases to consider:

1. [1 2 3] 5
2. 1 [2 3 5]

In the first case, the difference between the max and min elements of the window is two (3 - 1 == 2). In the second case, that difference is three (5 - 2 == 3). We want to write a function that will return the larger of these two differences.

    Be able to explain the time complexity of your solution
    Know the differences between a stack and a queue
    Be able to use simple data structures to build more complicated ones

Phase 1: Naive Solution

One approach to solving this problem would be:

    Initialize a local variable current_max_range to nil.
    Iterate over the array and consider each window of size w. For each window:
        Find the min value in the window.
        Find the max value in the window.
        Calculate max - min and compare it to current_max_range. Reset the value of current_max_range if necessary.
    Return current_max_range.

Implement this approach in a method, max_windowed_range(array, window_size). Make sure your code passes the following test cases:

windowed_max_range([1, 0, 2, 5, 4, 8], 2) == 4 # 4, 8
windowed_max_range([1, 0, 2, 5, 4, 8], 3) == 5 # 0, 2, 5
windowed_max_range([1, 0, 2, 5, 4, 8], 4) == 6 # 2, 5, 4, 8
windowed_max_range([1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 8], 5) == 6 # 3, 2, 5, 4, 8

Think about the time complexity of your method. How many iterations are required at each step? What is its overall time complexity in Big-O notation?
Analysis

It turns out that it is quite costly to calculate the min and max elements of each window (each method is an O(n) operation). If we use the min AND max methods built into Ruby, this costs us 2 * window_size iterations for each window (overall time complexity: O(n^2)).

What's more, in the naive solution, we consider each window as a slice of the input array. On the first iteration, we slice the array from index 0 to index w. On the second iteration, we slice from 1 to w + 1, and so forth. However, slicing an array is rather costly (again, O(n)). Remember, a new array is created when slicing an existing array.

What if it were possible to calculate min and max instantaneously (in constant time) per window? This would allow us to find the max windowed range in O(n) time. We can achieve this by writing a custom data structure dedicated to solving this specific problem.

Optimized Solution:

We will be creating a sequence of data structures that will culminate in a MinMaxStackQueue, our custom data structure that will keep track of the min and max in constant time. We will get to the specifics of how it does this in a second.

We will be building the following in order:

    MyQueue
    MyStack
    StackQueue
    MinMaxStack
    MinMaxStackQueue

Phase 2: MyQueue

Since the window only moves one index at a time, it would be nicer to represent it as a queue. Every time we move the window, we could enqueue the next element and dequeue the last element. This would allow us to avoid using Array#slice, so that we can traverse the array in constant time.

A queue is a simple abstract linear data structure where elements are stored in order and can be added or removed one at a time. A queue follows first in, first out (FIFO). Unlike Ruby's Array data structure, most Queue implementations do not expose methods to slice or sort the data, or to find a specific element. The basic operations are:

    Queue
        enqueue: adds an element to the back of the queue
        dequeue: removes an element from the front of the queue and returns it

We will also write a peek method, which returns the "top" or "next" item without actually removing it.

Queues may be implemented in terms of simpler data structures, such as linked lists, but in Ruby you can actually use an Array as the underlying data store, as long as you don't expose it publicly (i.e., don't define an attr_reader for it). We'll do this in today's exercises.

Implement a Queue class. Use the following initialize method as a starting point:

class MyQueue
  def initialize
    @store = []
  end
end

Implement peek, size, empty?, enqueue, and dequeue methods on your Queue.
Phase 3: MyStack

We want to find the max window range of array in O(n) time, which means we cannot make use of Array#slice, and each window must calculate the min and max instantly. Every time we move the window, we enqueue the next element and dequeue the last element. This solves the problem with slice. However, removing items from MyQueue takes O(n) time. As the first element of the array is shifted off, the remaining elements will be reassigned in new position in memory. Also, it still leaves us with the problem of expensive min and max operations. To resolve this, we'll have to make clever use of another data structure, the stack.

Stacks are another simple linear data structure. Elements are also stored in order and can be added or removed one at a time. A stack is first in, last out (FILO). Similar to queues, stack implementations do not expose methods to slice or sort the data, or to find a specific element. The basic operations are:

    Stack
        push: adds an element to the top of the stack
        pop: removes an element from the top of the stack and returns it

Implement a Stack class. Use the following initialize method as a starting point:

class MyStack
  def initialize
    @store = []
  end
end

Implement peek, size, empty?, pop and push methods on your Stack.

Phase 4: StackQueue

With that done, we're going to implement a queue again, but with a twist: rather than use an Array, we will implement it using our MyStack class under the hood because pushing and popping from MyStack takes O(1) time. Done properly, we will still have a queue but with the advantages of dequeuing in O(1) time.

Before you start to code this, sit down and talk to your partner about how you might implement this. You should not modify your MyStack class, but use the interface it provides to implement a queue.

When you're ready, implement this StackQueue class with size, empty?, enqueue, and dequeue methods.

Hint: You will want to use more than one instance of MyStack.

Hint 2: What if you always pushed onto one stack, and always popped from the other? How will these two stacks interact?

Hint 3: Think about how a slinky walks down stairs. As the slinky descends down a stair step, the top of a slinky becomes the bottom of the slinky...

Phase 5: MinMaxStack

Before we move on, let's take a step back to our MyStack class. We'll modify it so that we always know the maximum value in the stack. We could write a max method that calls @store.max. However, this requires us to iterate over every item in the @store array, which gives us a time complexity of O(n). This isn't good enough for us; we want to be able to return the max in constant time (O(1)). If we can't iterate over @store, how else could we modify the stack to get this functionality?

Once you have max implemented, it should be easy to add a min method.

Hint: We could store some metadata with the value of each element. In other words, we can be storing more information than just the value with new element to the store. Think about how to do this and what information to store.

Implement peek, size, empty?, max, min, pop, push methods on your MinMaxStack.
Phase 6: MinMaxStackQueue

Similar to MyStack (phase 3) was used to build StackQueue (phase 4), use your MinMaxStack (phase 5) to build a MinMaxStackQueue.

What methods are needed to solve this problem in O(n) time?
Phase 7: Max Windowed Range

Armed with a working MinMaxStackQueue, this problem should be much easier. You'll want to follow the same basic approach as above, but use our new data structure instead of array slices. As before, return the current_max_range at the end of the method. Make sure all the test cases pass, and that you both understand the time complexity of this solution.
