CSS Advanced Selectors Exercise

Download this skeleton. Update advanced_selectors.css to practice styling more elements with advanced selectors.

    Set the cursor:pointer and outline:none properties for all radio buttons, select elements, and submit buttons.
    Style the background-color of the submit button gold using the last-child selector and give it a darkening hover effect.
    Color every other list element in the directions list with a light-grey background.
    Use the + operator to select the first review immediately after the Reviews header element and give it a 1px, solid, black, top border (Hint: the class for a submitted review will be .user_review).
    Style the radio buttons with stars! Use the stars.png file in the assets folder. You will need to use the WebKit extension property -webkit-appearance: none;.
    The stars will be blue when hovered and will be yellow when checked. Use the :hover and :checked pseudo-classes to change the background-position property of the radio buttons (Hint: You want to move the background image to show a different part of the stars.png image).
